<p>Land O Lakes is located in Pasco County, Florida north of Tampa.  It has experienced tremendeous growth
over the past 20 years, evolving from a small farm town to a highly populated bedroom community of the 
Tampa Bay Area.  It's name is derived from the many lakes around here, not the butter!</p>

<p>The main subdivision of Land O Lakes is Lake Padgett Estates.  Over the years, many other subdivisions  
have been built such as Sable Ridge, Wilderness Lake Preserve, Oakstead, Connerton and Concord Station.  
Many of these new subdivisions include community pools, clubhouses and fitness centers.</p>

<p>Shopping and dining options were very limited, as many residents had to travel to Tampa to shop at major
stores and eat at favorite resturants.  Today, Land O' Lakes boasts many options, including 2 Publix locations,
Winn-Dixie and a Super Target and Super Wal-Mart in Lutz, south of Land O Lakes. Collier Commons is a major
shopping plaza that includes Publix (One of the chain's largest locations), Walgreens, clothing outlet Belk, and
restaurants including Chilis, Village Inn, Sonic, Moe's Southwest Grill and Starbucks.  There are also four 
banks and an apartment complex. All of this was built on a site that formerly housed horse stables. A few
miles east is the Shops at Wiregrass, an open air mall. </p>

<p>The two main throughfares of Land O Lakes are U.S. Highway 41 and State Road 54, both of which were two
lane roads. They have since been upgraded to six lane highways with lots of traffic volume.  Other
important roads include Parkway Boulevard, Collier Parkway, and Ehren Cutoff. The Suncoast Parkway,
a toll road west of Land O Lakes connects travelers with Crystal River in Citrus County and Tampa
International Airport.  Interstate 75 is accessible to the east of Land O Lakes.
